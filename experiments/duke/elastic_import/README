imports vivo_widgets data into an elastic instance

# Go 

This needs go 1.11.1 - because it uses the new 'mod' stuff

I've installed that locally with asdf, then set local GOPATH with direnv
but eventually this will be dockerized

# Setup

Requires a bit (now):

## postgresql
Running instance of postgresql with these credentials (hard coded for now)
	
* host     = "localhost"
* port     = 5432
* user     = "vivo_data"
* password = "experiment4"
* dbname   = "vivo_data"

also need to run 'migration' file init.sql:

## elastic
Running instance of elasticsearch
* localhost:9200

## Then `go` building ...
* > ./build.sh

## Then running ...

> cmd/widgets_importer/widgets_importer <file_of_duids.csv>
> cmd/elastic_import/elastic_importer [NOTE: only run once, unless ./clear-index.sh]

## To delete elastic indedx
> curl -XDELETE localhost:9200/people
