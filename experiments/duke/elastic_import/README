Imports vivo_widgets data into an Elastic instance

# Go 

This needs go >= 1.11.1 - because it uses the new 'mod' stuff

I've installed that locally with asdf, then set local GOPATH with direnv
but eventually this will be dockerized

# Setup

Requires a bit (now):

## postgresql
Running instance of postgresql with credentials that are
read from a './config.toml' file (see config.toml.example):
	
## elastic
Running instance of elasticsearch
* localhost:9200 

NOTE: these can both be started via docker-compose

> docker-compose up

or if one or other is already install locally

> docker-compose up <service_to_start>

## Importers (e.g. Go Code)

### Building

> ./build.sh

### Running

> cmd/widgets_import/widgets_import -config <config_file> -dry-run (true|false)
> cmd/elastic_import/elastic_import -config <config_file> 

[NOTE: only run once, unless -remove=true]

If you leave off the -config option it will default to ./config.toml

To delete elastic index (people for instance):
> curl -XDELETE localhost:9200/people

or

> cmd/elastic_import/elastic_import -type=people -remove=true


### Elastic caveats

It is possible that elastic_import may only work inside of the Docker instance. In which case you would do the following:

> cd produce-evolution-sandbox/experiments/duke/elastic_import
> docker-compose run --rm importer sh
> bash
> ./build.sh
> ./cmd/elastic_import/elastic_import -type all

If localhost:9200 does not display the Elasticsearch instance in your browser, try docker:9200 instead.

## Exporting data from Elasticsearch
> npm install elasticdump

### Backup index map to a file:
> ./bin/elasticdump \
  --input=http://docker:9200/people \
  --output=people_index_mapping.json \
  --type=mapping

### Backup index data to a file:
> ./bin/elasticdump \
  --input=http://docker:9200/people \
  --output=people_index_data.json \
  --type=data
