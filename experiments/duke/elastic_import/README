imports vivo_widgets data into an elastic instance

# Go 

This needs go >= 1.11.1 - because it uses the new 'mod' stuff

I've installed that locally with asdf, then set local GOPATH with direnv
but eventually this will be dockerized

# Setup

Requires a bit (now):

## postgresql
Running instance of postgresql with credentials that are
read from a './config.toml' file (see config.toml.example):
	
## elastic
Running instance of elasticsearch
* localhost:9200

NOTE: these can both be started via docker-compose

> docker-compose up

or if one or other is already install locally

> docker-compose up <service_to_start>

## Importers (e.g. Go Code)

### Building

> ./build.sh

### Running

> cmd/widgets_importer/widgets_importer -config <config_file> -dry-run (true|false)
> cmd/elastic_import/elastic_importer -config <config_file> 

[NOTE: only run once, unless -remove=true]

If you leave off the -config option it will default to ./config.toml

To delete elastic index (people for instance):
> curl -XDELETE localhost:9200/people

or

> cmd/elastic_import/elastic_import -type=people -remove=true
