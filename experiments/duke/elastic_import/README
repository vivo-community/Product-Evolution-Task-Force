imports vivo_widgets data into an elastic instance

# Go 

This needs go 1.11.1 - because it uses the new 'mod' stuff

I've installed that locally with asdf, then set local GOPATH with direnv
but eventually this will be dockerized

# Setup

Requires a bit (now):

## postgresql
Running instance of postgresql with credentials that are
read from a './config.toml' file (see config.toml.example):
	
## elastic
Running instance of elasticsearch
* localhost:9200

## Then `go` building ...
* > ./build.sh

## Then running ...

> cmd/widgets_importer/widgets_importer -config <config_file> -dry-run=(true|false)
> cmd/elastic_import/elastic_importer -config <config_file> 
[NOTE: only run once, unless -remove=true]

If you leave off the -config option it will default to ./config.toml

## To delete elastic indedx
> curl -XDELETE localhost:9200/people
or
> cmd/elastic_import/elastic_import -remove=true
