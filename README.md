# Product Evolution Action Planning and this repository

The VIVO Action Planning process grew out of the VIVO Strategy Meeting, March 1, 2018. Five areas of action planning were identified -- Resources, Vision, Community Engagement, Organization and Governance, and Product Evolution. The purpose of action planning is to create a plan and execute it over the the twelve month period March 1, 2018 to Feb 28, 2019.

The idea for this (yet to be officially name) repo emerged from Product Evolution brainstorming on how to share source files, sample/test data, and related artifacts in support of experiments and collaboration by this action planning group. Also see the References section below for related resources.

## Proposed repository structure

This structure is a strawman. One idea being to create/hold space for sample data in a variety of formats, including existing formats output by VIVO 1.x. Also to capture ideas and experiments with new user interface technologies.

./data

	./json
  
		./vivo-isf (example JSON docs generated by VIVO 1.9 could live here)
    
		./es (Elasticsearch)
    
		./solr (does VIVO 1.9 output any Solr JSON docs, or can those be accessed via Solr API?)
    
		./graphql
    
		./cuboulder
    
		./duke-widgets
    
		./wcm-reciter

	./xml
  
		./vivo-isf (example XML RDF docs generated by VIVO 1.9 could live here)
    
		./solr

	./n3
  
		./vivo-isf (example .n3 docs generated by VIVO 1.9 could live here)

./ux

	./facetview2 (example copy of faceted browsing UX derived from Cottage Labs code)
  
	./cu-boulder-capability-map (example copy of CUâ€™s ES-backed visualization?)
  
	./react-facet-example
  
	./polymer-facet-example
  
	./angular2-facet-example
  
	./vue-facet-example
  
	./apache-cordova-example

./etl

	./python
  
	./harvester

./VIVO-MVP.github.io (public GitHub Pages-hosted web site for this MVP or the broader product evolution effort?)
