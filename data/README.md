# Data: Examples, Experiments, Test Data

This repo subdirectory is intended to hold data including examples and experimental data to share and collaborate on the many current and future data models that inhabit the VIVO universe.

Ideally it will contain subdirectories to classify different data formats such as JSON, XML and others as proposed in the repo's main README. These subdirectories could then capture different data model samples, for example the JSON that is currently rendered by Vitro/VIVO 1.9 versus the JSON served by Duke for their popular Widgets service.

Examples, experiments, and possibly test data is in scope. The actual data model specs, implementations, tooling, etc are not intended to live here. Those source files, ontologies and related artifacts should live in their own repositories, e.g., https://github.com/OIT-ADS-Web/vivo_widgets, https://github.com/OIT-ADS-Web/duke_vivo_ontologies or https://github.com/openrif/vivo-isf-ontology
