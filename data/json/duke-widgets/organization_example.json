      "overview": "<p><b>Quantitative Electrophysiology - Activation of the Heart.</b> Simulation studies are being conducted on the activation process in cardiac tissue. To carry this out it is necessary to describe quantitatively the electrical (nonlinear) behavior of the cell membrane as well as to describe the electrical ``load\" (i.e. the electrical structure and conductivities of the intracellular and extracellular medium). For studies which emphasize activation alone the Hodgkin-Huxley and Ebihara-Johnson membrane models have been used. Where recovery is important the Beeler-Reuter and DiFrancesco-Noble models have been introduced.\n<p>Regarding the passive conductive properties of the cardiac muscle, because of its syncytial nature (arising from multiple low resistance intercellular junctions) the intracellular and interstitial space can be regarded as continua though coupled at all points through the cell membrane. This constitutes what has been called the bidomain model and is the basis for a partial differential equation description of the fields of interest. The directional differences in conductivity arising from the fiber orientation and myofibril structure can be taken into account by using an anisotropic conductivity tensor. In general the ratio of conductivities in the intracellular and interstitial spaces are unequal, according to the isolated experiments in the literature. \n<p>To date simulations have been carried out to describe current flow patterns that arise under different assumed anisotropy conditions for both electrotonus and action potential conditions. In one study the activation isochrones resulting from a point stimulation were determined for a two-dimensional homogeneous (though anisotropic) tissue. Based on the assumption of equal anisotropy ratio simulations have been performed for a semi-infinite and cylindrical bundle of tissue describing the character of the intracellular and interstitial field as a function of depth into the tissue from the extracellular (bounding) space. One sees a considerable non-uniformity of magnitude near the surface so that measurements typically made at the surface may not be representative of interior wave shape. In particular a wave initiated at one end of a cylindrical bundle will develop a curved phase front (curved isochrones). Other important consequences have to do with the resulting source strength, velocity of propagation, e The above research is ultimately directed toward models which may help elucidate the initiation of cardiac arrhythmias. \n<p>We are also interested in developing cardiac muscle models that will help clarify and elucidate the electrophysiological processes underlying defibrillation. We have examined one-dimensional models to date and pointed out the important role of the modified bidomain model which includes the junctional resistance. This work is limited to steady-state solutions; results emphasize a strong relationship to the size of the intercellular junction. Current efforts are directed at an examination of the transient response to a defibrillatory pulse by including the membrane capacitance. Still further efforts are based on including a quantitative description of the membrane ionic channels themselves. Our goal is eventual extension to a three-dimensional model.</p>\n\n<p>Further work is planned that will extend the aforementioned projects more fully to three dimensions, to arbitrary anisotropy, and to actual heart geometry. In particular we would like to extend work on one-dimensional propagation models which includes the discontinuous structure arising from intercellular junctions to three dimensions. Interest centers on explaining both normal and abnormal experimental studies. <br>\n  <br>\n  <b>Neural Stimulation</b>. We have been interested in developing and examining models arising from practical applications of functional electrical stimulation. Work completed to date includes the characterization and behavior of cuff electrodes which demonstrate the conditions under which unidirectional propagation results. We have also considered the response of a nerve bundle arising from a point stimulation source. Of particular interest was the determination of the effect of fiber position within a bundle on excitation threshold. In carrying out this latter study, the effect of current redistribution from interstitial to intracellular space was included, but only under steady-state conditions. This work needs to be extended to the transient case. </p>\n<p>The effect of electrode shape (electrode array) on stimulation properties is also of interest and will be considered in the future. The reciprocal problem, namely an investigation of the effect of electrode size and shape in electromyography, is currently being studied. </p>\n<p><strong>Electrophysiological Sources. </strong>When excitable tissue (nerve or muscle) is stimulated, the result is an action potential and associated action currents. The action currents, by depolarizing membranes adjacent to the site undergoing activation, serve to spread the activation --- and in this way result in the propagation of the impulse. The action currents fill the entire conducting region, according to the laws of electricity. As a result potential fields surrounding and at a distance from active processes can be detected and measured. Familiar examples are the electrocardiogram, electromyogram, etc. </p>\n<p>The relationship between underlying electrical activation processes(sources) and the potential fields they produce is of great interest. If carefully characterized the opportunity is present for learning about cellular processes based on external (noninvasive) measurements. This is important not only in clinical situations, but in basic research as well. </p>\n<p>The goal of this research is to develop quantitative formulations for the electrical generators associated with activation processes. The case of a single cell in a uniform volume conductor and its extension to the cylindrical fiber has been well studied over the last twenty years. Interest now centers on multi fiber preparations including muscle and nerve bundles, cardiac muscle, and smooth muscle. Such formulations are needed during activation as well as recovery. This is particularly important in the study of cardiac tissue since recovery is not propagated. </p>\n\n<p>As part of this study a particular effort is directed to a study of cardiac recovery and the T-wave. New experimental methods provide an opportunity, for the first time, to describe the action potential waveforms throughout the heart providing a useful database. The goal is the quantitative analysis of the origins of the T-wave as measured both on the torso and on the heart. </p>",

      "overview": "<p align=\"justify\">Cameron R. 'Dale' Bass is an Associate Research Professor with Duke's Department of Biomedical Engineering and Director of the Injury and Othopaedic Biomechanics Laboratory.\n<br>\n<p align=\"justify\">A major research focus of Dr. Bass is the study of blast-related brain injury and injury mechanisms.  Past research has concentrated air containing organs, such as the lungs and bowel. Results from the limited evidence of over 80 years of experimentation suggested that the brain tolerance for blast was much greater than the pulmonary tolerance for blast. However, recent anecdotal evidence suggests that many soldiers returning from combat have symptoms that are consistent with underlying brain injuries.  The etiology for these injuries is unclear and may include a spectrum of sources from blunt impact injuries to post traumatic stress disorder to primary blast injuries. \n<br>\n<p align=\"justify\">The primary goals of this research are to:<p>\n<ul><li>determine injury thresholds for blast brain injury\n<li>identify injury mechanisms underlying blast brain injury\n</li></ul></li></p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">This research may help reduce the frequency of brain injury caused by blast events, help identify treatments for such injury, and provide the knowledge to develop better protective equipment to protect against such injuries.   Many projects involve multi-disciplinary collaborations between BME, Duke University Medical Center, Durham Veterans Affairs, and other major research institutions.",

      "overview": "<p>Professor Bliss has broad research interests in fluid mechanics, aerodynamics, acoustics, and structural dynamics. His work emphasizes improved understandings of physical phenomena and the development of innovative ways to solve important engineering problems. Professor Bliss recently developed a general analysis method called Analytical/Numerical matching (ANM) that combines numerical and analytical solutions to gain accuracy and computational efficiency. ANM is currently being applied to a variety of problems in aerodynamics and structural acoustics.</p>\n\n<p>Much of Professor Bliss' research on fluid flows involves the aerodynamics of lifting surfaces and vortex wakes. For helicopter wakes he has developed curved vortex elements, constant vorticity contour wake models, and influence coefficient techniques. In collaboration with a private company, these have been incorporated into commercially available computer programs used by industry and government to predict helicopter performance, vibration, and noise. Currently, ANM is being used to develop a new unified treatment of lifting surfaces and wakes in unsteady compressible flow. Professor Bliss is also developing a new vortex roll-up analysis, and using ANM to study helicopter blade/vortex interaction.</p>\n\n<p>In acoustics, Professor Bliss' primary effort is in the application of ANM to structural acoustics, particularly to acoustic scattering from submerged elastic bodies with structural discontinuities. He has also developed a method called Alternate Resonance Tuning (ART) to prevent low frequency sound transmission into flexible wall enclosures, with applications to aircraft interior noise. He also conducts research on mathematical homogenization applied to structural acoustic systems, and on general boundary conditions for bulk-reacting sound absorbing surfaces. </p>",

      "overview": "Volker Blum heads the <a href=\"http://aims.pratt.duke.edu\">\"Ab initio materials simulations\" group</a> at Duke University. Dr. Blum's research focuses on \"first-principles\" computational materials science: using the fundamental laws of quantum mechanics to predict the properties of real materials from the atomic scale on upwards. <br /><br />Specific focus areas are interface and nanoscale systems with electronic and energy applications, as well as work on molecular structure and spectroscopy. Recent research topics include structure and properties of graphene on the semiconducting substrate, SiC; structure and electronic properties of new materials for photovoltaics; organic-inorganic hybrid materials; carbon-nitride materials for photocatalysis; and more. <br /><br />Dr. Blum is the coordinator of a major computer package for computational materials and molecular science based on electronic structure theory, FHI-aims. Work in his group is interdisciplinary (touching areas of physics and chemistry in addition to materials science), with opportunities for international collaboration and exchange. Active collaborations include groups in Berlin, Munich, London, Hefei, and elsewhere.",

In 2016, she completed a Ph.D. in Mechanical engineering, also at McGill University.</p>\r\n<p>Her doctoral research involved a return to the foundational work of George Zames, exploring how the theory of conic sectors can be used to design controllers that guarantee closed-loop input-output stability when more conventional methods fail to apply. Her graduate studies involved research semesters at University of Michigan, University of Bern, and University of Victoria, along with an internship at Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories (MERL) in Boston.</p>\r\n<p>Through her research, Leila strives to bridge the gap between theoretical results in robust and optimal control and their use in practice. She explores how the tools of numerical analysis and input-output stability theory can be applied to the most challenging of controls problems, including the control of delayed, open-loop unstable, and nonminimum-phase systems.&nbsp; Her focus has been on the development of readily-applicable controller synthesis and stability analysis methods based on the evaluation of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Resulting publications have considered applications of this work to robotic, process control, and time-delay systems.<br /><br />She is also interested in model predictive control (MPC) especially when applied to switched systems. Bridgeman continues to collaborate with colleagues at MERL, enabling the use of MPC in novel applications including networked systems, vehicle control, heating, and ventilation.</p>",

Micropatterning of extracellular matrix proteins or protein hydrogels and engineering of synthetic scaffolds are used to build stem cell-derived cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues that replicate the structure-function relationships present in healthy and diseased muscle. These systems are used to separate and systematically study the roles of structural and genetic factors that contribute cardiac and skeletal muscle function and disease at multiple organizational levels (from single cell to 3-dimensional tissue). Optical recordings with voltage and calcium sensitive dyes in synthetic tissues allow us to analyze and optimize normal electrical function as well as study complicated spatio-temporal changes in electrical activity encountered in cardiac arrhythmias and fibrillation. Contractile force measurements allow us to explore factors that would optimize mechanical function of engineered tissues. Examples of the current research projects include: 1) design of co-cultures made of cardiac and different types of stem cells to model and study cell and tissue therapies for cardiac infarction and arrhythmias, 2) local and global gene manipulation in cultures of cardiac and other cell types, 3) engineering of vascularized cardiac and skeletal muscle tissue constructs with controllable structure and function, 4) implantation of stem cell-derived cardiac tissue patches in animal models of cardiac infarction, and 5) design of synthetic excitable tissues for experimental studies and novel cell therapies.</p>",

Before joining Duke he was Professor of Electrical Engineering and Mathematics at Princeton University where he also directed the Program in Applied and Computational Mathematics.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Before joining Princeton University Dr. Calderbank was Vice President for Research at AT&amp;T. As Vice President for Research he managed AT&amp;T intellectual property, and he was responsible for licensing revenue. AT&amp;T Labs was the first of a new type of research lab where masses of data generated by network services became a giant sandbox in which fundamental discoveries in information science became a source of commercial advantage</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>At Duke, Dr. Calderbank works with researchers from the Duke Center for Autism and Brain Development, developing information technology that is able to capture a full spectrum of behavior in very young children. By supporting more consistent and cost-effective early diagnosis, the team is increasing the opportunity for early interventions that have proven very effective.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>At the start of his career at Bell Labs, Dr. Calderbank developed voiceband modem technology that was widely licensed and incorporated in over a billion devices. Voiceband means the signals are audible so these modems burped and squeaked as they connected to the internet. One of these products was the AT&amp;T COMSPHERE<sup>&reg;</sup> modem which was the fastest modem in the world in 1994 &ndash; at 33.6kb/s!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Together with Peter Shor and colleagues at AT&amp;T Labs Dr. Calderbank developed the group theoretic framework for quantum error correction. This framework changed the way physicists view quantum entanglement, and provided the foundation for fault tolerant quantum computation.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Dr. Calderbank has also developed technology that improves the speed and reliability of wireless communication by correlating signals across several transmit antennas. Invented in 1996, this <i>space-time coding</i> technology has been incorporated in a broad range of 3G, 4G and 5G wireless standards. He served on the Technical Advisory Board of Flarion Technologies a wireless infrastructure company founded by Rajiv Laroia and acquired by Qualcomm for $1B in 2008.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Dr. Calderbank is an IEEE Fellow and an AT&amp;T Fellow, and he was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 2005. He received the 2013 IEEE Hamming Medal for contributions to coding theory and communications and the 2015 Shannon Award.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

His research group studies&nbsp; elementary excitations in condensed-matter systems (phonons, electrons, spins), their couplings (phonon-phonon interaction, electron-phonon coupling, spin-phonon coupling), and their effects on macroscopic material properties. Current materials of interest include thermoelectrics, ferroelectrics/multiferroics, spin-caloritronics, and photovoltaics. We develop new methods to reveal microscopic underpinnings of thermal transport, by integrating neutron and x-ray scattering measurements with quantum-mechanical computer simulations. This combined experimental and computational approach opens a new window to understand and control microscopic energy transport for the design of materials with novel properties (thermoelectrics, spin-caloritronics), and to rationalize multiferroics and metal-insulator transitions. In addition to state-of-the-art scattering experiments and first-principles simulations, our team also uses transport measurements, optical spectroscopy, materials synthesis, calorimetry, and thermal characterization, with the goal of gaining deeper atomistic understanding for developing future materials.</p>",

      "overview": "Mark W. Dewhirst, DVM, PhD is the Gustavo S. Montana Professor of Radiation Oncology and Vice Director for Basic Science in the Duke Cancer Institute. Dr. Dewhirst has research interests in tumor hypoxia, angiogenesis, hyperthermia and drug transport. He has spent 30 years studying causes of tumor hypoxia and the use of hyperthermia to treat cancer. In collaboration with Professor David Needham in the Pratt School of Engineering, he has developed a novel thermally sensitive drug carrying liposome that has been successfully translated to human clinical trials. He has utilized the thermal characteristics of this liposome to develop an MR imageable form that can accurately reflect drug concentrations in tumors, which then is related to the extent of anti-tumor effect in pre-clinical models. This property has been widely used by other investigators, world-wide, particularly in the area of high intensity focused ultrasound, where it would be possible to literally paint drug to a target zone and visualize this process in real time, during heating. For his work in this area, Dr. Dewhirst was named a Fellow in the AAAS. Dr. Dewhirst has well over 500 peer-reviewed publications, book chapters and reviews, with &gt;20,000 citations and an H-index of 73. He has given named lectures at the University of Western Ontario, Thomas Jefferson University and the New Zealand Cancer Society. He was awarded the Failla Medal and Lecture at the Radiation Research Society in 2008, the Eugene Robinson award for excellence hyperthermia research in 1992 and a similar award from the European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology in 2009. He was named a fellow of ASTRO in 2009 and was awarded the prestigious Gold Medal from the same society in 2012. He is a Senior Editor of Cancer Research and Editor-in-Chief of the International Journal of Hyperthermia. He has mentored 24 graduate students, and many postdoctoral fellows, residents, junior faculty and medical students. He has been particularly skillful in assisting those he has mentored to obtain DOD and NIH fellowships, K awards and first R01 grants. His skill in mentoring has been recognized by the Duke Comprehensive Cancer Center, the Medical Physics Graduate Training programs and the School of Medicine, where he has received &ldquo;Mentor of the Year&rdquo; awards. In 2011 he was selected to become the first Associate Dean of Faculty Mentoring in the Duke School of Medicine. In this position, he is implementing a comprehensive program to enhance success in obtaining NIH funding. He graduated from the University of Arizona in 1971 with a degree in Chemistry and Colorado State University in 1975 and 1979 with DVM and PhD degrees, respectively.",

      "overview": "Dr. Di Giulio serves as Director of Duke University's Integrated Toxicology Program and the Superfund Basic Research Center.\n\nDr. Di Giulio's research is concerned with basic studies of mechanisms of contaminant metabolism, adaptation and toxicity, and with the development of mechanistically-based indices of exposure and toxicity that can be employed in biomonitoring. The long term goals of this research are to bridge the gap between mechanistic toxicological research and the development of useful tools for environmental assessment, and to elucidate linkages between human and ecosystem health. The bulk of Dr. Di Giulio's work employs a comparative approach with aquatic animals, particularly fishes, as models. Of particular concern are mechanisms of oxidative metabolism of aromatic hydrocarbons, mechanisms of free radical production and antioxidant defense, and mechanisms of chemical carcinogenesis, developmental perturbations and adaptations to contaminated environments by fishes.",

      "overview": "Development of Bayesian statistical methods and approaches for uncertainty quantification motivated by applications with complex and high-dimensional data. &nbsp;A particular interest is in high-dimensional low sample size data in which it is necessary to incorporate dimensional reduction through carefully designed prior distributions and challenges arise in efficiently computing posterior approximations. Ongoing focus areas include new algorithms for approximating posterior distributions in big data settings, nonparametric Bayes probability modeling allowing for uncertainty in distributional assumptions, analysis of network data, incorporating physical and geometric prior knowledge in modeling and novel models for dimension reduction for \"object data\" (functions, tensors, shapes, etc). &nbsp;Primary application areas include genomics, neurosciences, epidemiology, and reproductive studies but with much broader interests in developing new methods motivated by difficult applications (in art, music, radar, imaging processing, etc).",

This work has been published in <i>Climatic Change</i>, <i>Global Environmental Change</i>, and <i>Environmental Science &amp; Policy</i>, among other places. My current research investigates how real options analysis can be applied to policy decisions on geoengineering, and how trading on climate change damages and risk can be better understood by looking at the reinsurance industry. I have over fifteen years of experience in climate change, clean energy, and related environmental policy issues, and seven years with a prior career focus on international political development and conflict resolution.

Specifically, the laboratory uses high performance mass spectrometry techniques (e.g. UHPLC-Orbitrap MS/MS) to detect, identify, and quantify emerging contaminants (including endocrine disruptors, pharmaceuticals, and surfactants) in wastewater and drinking water. Another significant research thrust involves the development of sensitive trace analytical techniques for quantifying and characterizing single-walled carbon nanotubes in water, sediment, and aquatic organism tissues. For this work, near infrared fluorescence spectroscopy (NIRF) is used as a primary tool for resolving these novel nanoparticulate contaminants in highly complex environmental mixtures.</p>\r\n<p>The analytical methods developed in the Ferguson laboratory laboratory (for both nanoparticles and organic contaminants) are applied to both process-oriented environmental chemistry experiments in the field and laboratory as well as to toxicity bioassays (including whole-organism assays and molecular endpoints). The overarching goal is to gain an increased understanding of how emerging contaminants are transported, transformed and induce deleterious effects within aquatic ecosystems.</p>",

Decision-making processes are automated based on concepts drawn from control theory and the life sciences. Recent efforts have focused on the development of reconfigurable controllers implementing neural networks with procedural long-term memories. Full-scale simulations show that these controllers are capable of learning from new and unmodeled aircraft dynamics in real time, improving performance and even preventing loss of control in the event of control failures, nonlinear and near-stall dynamics, and parameter variations. New optimal control problems and methods based on computational geometry are being investigated to improve the effectiveness of integrated surveillance systems by networks of autonomous vehicles, such as, underwater gliders and ground robots.</p>",

      "overview": "<p>Professor Garg's areas of interest include modeling, simulation, and control of dynamic systems and robotics. In particular, his research deals with characterization and control of nonlinear phenomena in physical systems such as robots, automated manufacturing, and high-speed ground transportation. In the area of robotics, he is interested in the design of feedback controllers using the concepts of modern control theory. In the area of high-speed ground transportation, he has conducted research on dynamics and control of ground-based, air-cushion and magnetically levitated vehicles.            </p>\n            <p>One challenging area of research which Professor Garg is currently\n              pursuing deals with the coordination and control of two robots\n              handling a large structural object performing a series of intricate\n              maneuvers in a confined work space. Analytical development of path\n              planning and collision avoidance strategies and their practical\n              implementation are being carried out in the <a href=\"http://ramalab.pratt.duke.edu\" target=\"_blank\">Robotics\n              and Manufacturing Automation (RAMA)</a> laboratory. Two ABB Industrial\n              grade six-degree-of freedom revolute jointed robots are available\n              for these experiments. Major challenges related to this research\n              effort include the identification and design of techniques for\n              incorporating sensory data in the control algorithm, modeling the\n              nonlinear dynamics of the manipulators, and the development of\n              intelligent and adaptive control schemes for the coordination of\n              multiple arms in the presence of unknown parameters and payload\n              variations. Another area of research that Professor Garg is actively pursuing is sensor modeling, data acquisition and management, and data fusion in the context of swarm robotics.  For the experimental work in this area, the Robot Control Laboratory has a number of KheperaII robots, LADAR sensors, and vision sensors.</p>",

In particular, they are exploring nonlinear optical methods for frequency converting and impedance matching photons emitted from one type of quantum memory (e.g., trapped ions) to another (e.g., quantum dots).</p>\r\n<p>In another project, they are exploring methods for efficiently transmitting a large number of bits of information per photon. They are encoding information on the various photon degrees of freedom, such as the transverse modes, one photon at a time, and using efficient mode sorters to direct the photons to single-photon detectors. The experiments make use of multi-mode spontaneous down conversion in a nonlinear crystal to produce quantum correlated or entangled photon pairs.</p>\r\n<p>Another recent interest is the development of the world's most sensitive all-optical switch. Currently, they have observed switching with an energy density as low as a few hundred yoctoJoules per atomic cross-section, indicating that the switch should be able to operate at the single-photon level. The experiments use a quasi-one-dimensional ultra-cold gas of rubidium atoms as the nonlinear material. They take advantage of a one-dimensional optical lattice to greatly increase the nonlinear light-matter interaction strength.</p>\r\n<p>In the area of nonlinear dynamics, his group is interested in the control and synchronization of chaotic devices, especially optical and radio-frequency electronic systems.&nbsp; They are developing new methods for private communication of information using chaotic carriers, using chaotic elements for distance sensing (e.g., low-probability-of-detection radar), using networks of chaotic elements for remote sensing, and using chaotic elements for generating truly random numbers at high data rates. Recently, the have observed 'Boolean chaos,' where complex behavior is observed in a small network of commercially-available free-running logic gates.</p>",

In the same year he joined the Politecnico of Torino where he was finally appointed as Full Professor in Gasdynamics from 1981 to his retirement in 2012. His publications are devoted to many aspects of the fluid dynamics, they are mainly theoretical but always with a precise interest in the possible applications. Main results are the following. A system of orthogonal coordinates has been introduced in the study of the flow in helical pipes and more generally in pipes provided with a variable curvature and torsion of the central axis. This system of coordinates has been applied in many computations and it has contributed to clarify the effect of the curvature and the torsion on the axial and the secondary flows. In the field of turbulence modeling a new operational multiscale approach based on the generalized central moments and their properties has been produced. Principal application has been the dynamic procedure that significantly improves existing subgrid scale models for the Large Eddy Simulation of turbulent flows.</p>",

      "overview": "The Hinton laboratory focuses on mechanistic toxicity in all life stages of small, aquarium model fish and in selected species with particular environmental relevance (freshwater and marine). With the latter, investigations focus on stressor responses and include follow up studies after oil spills. Studies with the laboratory model fish take advantage of the compressed life cycle to improve understanding of organellar, cellular and tissues responses that arise after exposure and follow either a temporal and/or a concentration gradient. At the end of these serial examinations, we have pioneered the use of high resolution light and fluorescent microscopy and electron microscopy in these small fish species to better understand resultant phenotypes and to correlate structural alteration with molecular biological studies. In this way we are anchoring phenotypes with gene expression. In individual fish where specific genes have been mutated (Collaboration with Dr. Keith Cheng, Hershey Medical Center, Hershey, PA) or in individuals exposed to organic substances of known or expected toxicity, structural analysis at various levels of biological organization enables integration across all levels of biological organization enabling whole body phenomics. Special projects include The Duke Superfund Research Center, 2P42-ESO10356-10A2, supported by NIH/NIEHS. Studies investigate responses of fish to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and include early life stages and multigenerational effects. Contaminated and reference sites are included in these investigations of feral fish. Also, we receive funding as part of theme 2 of the Center for Environmental Implications of Nano Technology (CEINT). Our studies seek to determine whether there are specific toxic consequences upon exposure to nano silver (Ag NPs) versus exposure to conventional silver. We hosted Na Zheng (Angie), Visiting Investigator, Associate Professor, Northeast Institute of Geography and Agricultural Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. She was the recipient of a K.C. Wong award supporting her role as visiting investigator. Together, we investigated metals mixtures and embryo toxicity. We collaborate with Stella Marinakos, Pratt School and CEINT on the synthesis and refinement of nanoselenium. This complements work done over the past year with seleno-methionine and sodium selenite in parental and embryo exposures. We continue to investigate ways to assess whole body responses of aquarium model fish and to link phenotype to genotype. Collaboration with the Stapleton laboratory has investigated alterations in embryo and larval zebrafish exposed to flame retardant compounds and selected metabolites. Here our morphologic investigations have helped to differentiate between delayed development and toxicity in the developing eye.",

      "overview": "<p>The overall goal of my research program is to utilize an interdisciplinary approach to first advance the basic understanding of mechanotransduction on multiple scales and then use this knowledge to guide the development of new treatments for mechanosensitive diseases. Our work combines principles and techniques from protein engineering, molecular biology, soft matter physics, cell and developmental biology, biomaterials engineering, automated image analysis, and state of the art live cell microscopy. Specifically, we engineer and use biosensors that report the tension across specific proteins in living cells through changes in the color of light they emit. This technology enables dynamic measurements of proteins and sub-cellular structures that are under load. Unlike more traditional techniques that measure the entirety of cellular force output, the ability of these sensors to measure mechanical stress at the molecular level means they are innately compatible with concepts and approaches common in molecular biology and biophysics.</p>",

      "overview": "<p>Professor Howle's research interests span the disciplines of thermal science, fluid dynamics, and nonlinear dynamics. His present research projects - visualization of convective fluid patterns, stabilization of the no-motion state in free convection and bifurcation in imperfect or distributed parameter systems - are split evenly between experimental and computational methods.</p>\n\n<p>A key problem facing researchers studying convection in fluid-saturated porous media is the lack of a general, non-invasive method for pattern visualization and wave number measurement. Professor Howle designed innovative porous media which allow optical techniques to be used for the first time as a pattern visualization tool in the study of porous media convection.</p>\n\n<p>Computational spectral methods are efficient methods of simulation of small aspect ratio convection systems. For large problems, these methods can become too expensive to be practical. Professor Howle developed a reduced Galerkin method which decreases the execution time by orders of magnitude for large problems. This extends the range of problems for which certain spectral methods may be used. He is currently studying porous free convection in systems with distributed properties and binary convection using the reduced Galerkin method. </p>",

Bacteria are the most diverse organisms on earth and play a pivotal role in planetary cycling of nutrients and energy.  Yet, we have a poor understanding of the factors that drive their diversity and dynamics in the environment.  The lab's emphasis is on studying bacterial interactions with the environment at the appropriate temporal and spatial scale including the effect of temperature changes on bacterial populations and bacterial interactions with other organisms.  Another area of active research is the response and adaptation of bacteria to emerging pollutants such as antibiotics and nanoparticles.",

      "overview": "<p>Dr. Katz's research interests emphasize methods for prophylaxis against STD's, including topical microbicides, and for contraception. &nbsp;Core perspectives and approaches include mass transport phenomena and biofluid mechanics; rheology and imaging, both <em>in vitro</em> and <em>in vivo</em>. &nbsp;These are integrated to fundamental biological, pathological, and clinical processes and needs for improvement.</p>\r\n<strong>Context</strong>. According to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, 40 million people worldwide are currently living with AIDS. Even 13 years ago, in 2003, 3 million people died of AIDS and 5 million new people became infected. These epidemiological figures are not significantly improving.&nbsp;<i>Prevention</i> of initial infection by HIV, as well as <i>treatment</i> of the AIDS disease, is critical to combating this terrible worldwide pandemic. Vaccines are one type of AIDS prevention modality, and there is much current research on them. However, this research is expected to require about another 6 - 10 years before efficacious products might become available, and there is no guarantee that successful vaccines will be developed, even in this extended time frame. An alternative prevention method is the use of topical formulations (e.g. gels, foams, intravaginal rings, suppositories, etc.) that a woman inserts into her reproductive tract and which prevent HIV (or other pathogens) from initiating infection. Some of these can also be applied rectally to prevent infection in that compartment. Academic and industrial researchers are currently developing and evaluating a new class of compounds, termed topical <i>microbicides</i>. These compounds kill or dysfunctionalize HIV or other target pathogens upon contact in the female reproductive tract. To-date, microbicide research has been directed almost exclusively toward discovery of new, improved microbicidal compounds. There has been virtually no companion effort on rational design of the formulations which women apply and which deliver microbicides to the target pathogens. We do not yet understand what physical and chemical properties microbicidal formulations should have in order to be most effective in preventing infection. Objective standards for evaluation of such formulations do not exist. The effectiveness of microbicidal formulations depends upon their ability to coat the surfaces of the lower reproductive tract, and to remain in place during the time when a woman is exposed to HIV. Our research group is pioneering analysis of the physical and chemical mechanisms responsible for such distribution and retention of microbicidal formulations (termed <i>deployment</i>) and for the <i>delivery</i> of the microbicidal molecules to target tissues, fluids and the pathogens themselves. This work is being translated to practical application in the evaluation of current candidate microbicidal formulations and in development of improved ones.<br /><br />Our work also focuses upon methods of contraception, drawing upon Dr. Katz's vast experience in working in this field and in reproductive biology and medicine more broadly. &nbsp;in particular, we are working on methods, primarily for use by women and under their control, that simultaneously provide contraceptive protection, and protection and HIV and other sexually transmitted pathogens, e.g. human papilloma virus (HPV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV).<br />\r\n<p>Our research on microbicidal formulation <i>deployment</i> and <i>drug delivery</i> utilizes the methods of mechanical, chemical, electrical and optical engineering and materials science. Our work integrates two types of research: (1) we are undertaking fundamental studies of the mechanisms of formulation deployment and delivery; and (2) we are imaging and analyzing the distributions of formulations over the tissue surfaces of the lower reproductive tract in women, and the concentrations and transport of drugs from formulations onto and into luminal fluids and mucosal tissues. The fundamental studies have two components: theoretical analyses of fluid mechanical and other mass transport processes underlying deployment and drug delivery are linked to experimental simulations (in the laboratory) of salient flow and mass transport mechanisms. For example we developed a spectrophotometric method for analyzing microbicide diffusion from a formulation into cervical mucus. We have built experimental simulations of how gravity and the squeezing forces of vaginal epithelial surfaces cause a formulation to flow over those surfaces. We have built a simulation of how mixing of a microbicidal formulation with ambient <i>in vivo</i> fluids (e.g. vaginal fluid, semen) alters the formulation's properties and, therefore, its tendency to flow and adhere to epithelial surfaces. We also perform experimental measurements of fundamental material properties of formulations such as rheological and surface properties. These serve as inputs to the theoretical models of mass transport and flow. The mathematical models reveal particular relationships between properties of formulations and deployment and delivery characteristics.</p>\r\n<p>We also measure in women the spreading and retention in the vagina of different vaginal formulations. &nbsp;Our human studies are conducted in the clinic of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Duke Medical Center. We apply a new, unique imaging instrument built by us, that shares some features with the endoscopes currently used clinically to visualize some interior regions of the body. Our instrument measures the local thickness of coating of the vaginal surfaces with a test formulation. It detects 'bare spots' of uncoated tissue that might be particularly vulnerable to infection. We have also pioneered use of optical methods to measure local drug concentrations, as they are transported from their vehicles into luminal fluids and mucosal tissues. &nbsp;This latter work has initially been <em>in vitro.</em>&nbsp;We are currently working to expand it to direct i<em>n vivo</em> measurements, which will be a breakthrough technology in analyzing mucosal drug delivery.<br /><br />The above biophysics and biomedical engineering based work is also integrated to behavioral studies of users' perceptions and preferences of different contraceptive and STD prophylactic products. &nbsp;The goal is to improve willingness to use these products, by designing them with properties and dosage regimens that achieve their pharmacological goals simultaneously with their user friendliness.<br /><br />Collectively, our computational, <em>in vitro</em> and <em>in vivo</em> studies are integrated in creating new perspective and algorithms for product design and performance evaluation. &nbsp;They are currently being applied in development of a number of products in the HIV/STD prevention and contraception pipelines.</p>\r\n<p>Our research has been sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the American Foundation for AIDS Research, the US Agency for International Development, the Population Council, and the CONRAD Program.</p>",

      "overview": "<p>Josiah Knight, Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering, is Co-Director of the Energy and Environment Certificate, a program \nthat prepares students to confront complex problems in providing safe, clean, reliable and affordable energy.  The curriculum brings \ntogether students from arts and sciences as well as engineering in a series of courses spanning natural science, social science and \ntechnology, culminating in a capstone course in which multidisciplinary teams design, build, test and evaluate energy system prototypes. \nIn the process, students learn to communicate across a spectrum of backgrounds and interests, as they must do to address energy problems \nin the larger world.</p>\n\n<p>Knight's current research interests are in solar thermal energy and alternate propulsion methods for ground transportation.  Solar thermal energy, in addition to direct uses for space, water and industrial heating, has been shown to be an efficient means of electricity generation. Much progress has been made in recent years on fault-tolerant solar thermal collectors, and integration of such systems with distributed power generation is a promising path toward low-carbon electricity.</p>\n<p>Alternatives to the gasoline and diesel internal combustion engine have potential to expand the range of fuels that can be efficiently used for transportation and stationary power.  A major issue in the development of biofuels for ICEs is that much of the heating value of the biomass is consumed in transforming the solids to liquid fuels.  Burning solid biomass directly delivers greater net energy, but must be done in external combustion.  Activity in this area is presently focused on optimizing performance of external combustion engines by using adaptive intake and exhaust porting and closed-loop valve control.  The area is rich in both applied and basic \nquestions that couple thermodynamics and electro-mechanical dynamics in nonlinear regimes. </p>",

His earlier degrees were an M.S. from Stanford in 1989 and a B.S. from Oregon State University in 1986. Before joining the Duke faculty in 1992, Dr. Laursen worked as a solid mechanics analyst at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory from 1986 to 1992. He had obtained previous structural analysis experience while working for Boeing in 1985.</p>\r\n<p>At Duke, Dr. Laursen teaches undergraduate courses in engineering computing and engineering science and teaches graduate courses in continuum mechanics, engineering analysis, finite element methods, and the use of finite element methods for the solution of nonlinear problems. His research activities fall largely under these same categories, with a special interest in the modeling of physical systems exhibiting contact and friction phenomena in the presence of large deformations, inelasticity, and other sources of nonlinearity. Applications for this work are to be found in such diverse settings as crashworthiness evaluation for automobiles, wear characterization, metal forming applications, and the geophysical description of slip propagation in fault zones.</p>\r\n<p>Dr. Laursen's published work appears in such journals as the Journal of Applied Mechanics, International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering, Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering, Journal of Materials Research, International Journal of Solids and Structures, Computers and Structures, and Communications in Numerical Methods in Engineering.</p>",

Current projects involve (1) the development of mathematical models of the mammalian kidney and the application of these models to investigate the mechanism by which some mammals (and birds) can produce a urine that has a much higher osmolality than that of blood plasma; (2) the study of the origin of the irregular oscillations exhibited by the tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) system, which regulates fluid delivery into renal tubules, in hypertensive rats; (3) the investigation of the interactions of the TGF system and the urine concentrating mechanism; (4) the development of a dynamic epithelial transport model of the proximal tubule and the incorporation of that model into a TGF framework.\n\n<p>\n\n<b>Multiscale numerical methods.</b>\n\nI develop multiscale numerical methods---multi-implicit Picard integral deferred correction methods---for the integration of partial differential equations arising in physical systems with dynamics that involve two or more processes with widely-differing characteristic time scales (e.g., combustion, transport of air pollutants, etc.). These methods avoid the solution of nonlinear coupled equations, and allow  processes to decoupled (like in operating-splitting methods) while generating arbitrarily high-order solutions.\n\n<p>\n\n<b>Numerical methods for immersed boundary problems.</b>\n\nI develop numerical methods to simulate fluid motion driven by forces singularly supported along a boundary immersed in an incompressible fluid.",

      "overview": "My lab focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer using advanced imaging techniques. There are 2 main projects: radiomics and breast modeling. <br /> <br />First, radiomics is an interdisciplinary field combining computer vision, machine learning, and informatics. We develop computer vision algorithms to detect suspicious mammographic lesions. We also created predictive models that use machine learning and statistical analysis in order to classify mammograms. In ongoing studies funded by NIH, DOD, and several other organizations, we are addressing the clinically significant challenge of over-diagnosis of DCIS. By exploring the relationship between imaging findings and genomic markers, we seek to predict which cases of DCIS are likely to be indolent vs. aggressive, thus providing women with more personalized risk assessment to inform their treatment decisions. &nbsp;<br /> <br />Second, we are designing new virtual breast models that are based on actual patient data. These models go far beyond conventional phantoms in portraying realistic breast anatomy. Furthermore, we can transform these virtual models into physical form using the latest 3D printing technology. Such physical phantoms can be scanned on actual mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis systems, allowing us to assess image quality in new ways that are not only quantitative but also clinically relevant. We continue to refine the realism of these physical phantoms, and seek to develop new procedures for quality control, system evaluation, and the long term goal of virtual clinical trials.<br /><br />",

      "overview": "My research focuses on investigating relationships between structural and mechanical properties of biopolymers (polysaccharides, DNA, proteins), which I study at a single molecule level. My main approaches are experimental scanning probe microscopy techniques and computational methods involving Molecular Dynamics simulations and ab initio quantum mechanical calculations. The ultimate goal of this research is to understand the above-mentioned relationships at an atomic level and to apply the knowledge gained towards elucidating basic phenomena such as: molecular recognition that mediates interactions between proteins and sugars, mechanotransduction that underlies mechanical sensing and hearing in all organisms, and protein folding that is fundamental to all biology. Our DNA research is aimed at exploiting atomic force microscopy techniques to develop new ultra-sensitive assays for detecting and examining DNA damage, the process underlying carcinogenesis, and to increase our mechanistic understanding of DNA damage and repair processes. This research, in addition to its basic science aspects will lay a foundation for the future use of AFM technologies in the nanoscale DNA diagnostics with a potential to directly benefit human health.",

      "overview": "<p>Dr. Meyer studies the effects of toxic agents and stressors on human and wildlife health. He is particularly interested in understanding the mechanisms by which environmental agents cause DNA damage, the molecular processes that organisms employ to protect prevent and repair DNA damage, and genetic differences that may lead to increased or decreased sensitivity to DNA damage. Mitochondrial DNA damage and repair, as well as mitochondrial function in general, are a particular focus. He studies these effects in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, in cell culture, and collaboratively in other laboratory model organisms as well as in human populations in the USA and globally.</p>",

      "overview": "<STRONG>\nElectroporation-Mediated Drug and Gene Delivery</font></STRONG>\n<BR>\nElectroporation refers to the creation of small (1-40 nm) pores in the lipid bilayer of the membrane in response to large electric shocks.  Electroporation occurs as an undesirable side effect in accidental contacts with high voltage wires or when defibrillation shocks are applied to the heart to prevent sudden cardiac death. However, electroporation has also important applications in biotechnology, as pores allow the introduction of drugs and DNA into cells.  Still, this technique is largely empirical and the results are often variable and difficult to control. Our research in this area concentrates on the development of a model of electroporation that would allow theoretical investigation of the creation of pores during the shock, the flow of ions, drugs, and DNA through pores, and the resulting changes in intracellular concentrations.\n\n<p>\n<STRONG>\nNonlinear Dynamics Approach to Cardiac Arrhythmias </FONT></STRONG>\n<BR>\nCardiac arrhythmias, serious and potentially fatal diseases, can only rarely be successfully controlled with medication. The only available treatment is defibrillation, the delivery of a large electric shock.  Such shocks often have serious side effects. Our research investigates\nthe feasibility of alternative treatments for cardiac tachyarrhythmias that instead of large shocks use an appropriately timed train of small pulses.  The approach is based on the feedback protocols that have been developed to control the dynamics of complex nonlinear systems and involves animal experiments, mathematical modeling, and computer simulations.  These studies allow us to gain a better insight into the dynamics of cardiac rhythm and to assess the feasibility of bringing an episode of arrhythmia under control, terminate it, or even inhibit its occurrence.",

My research is focused on the link between acoustic and motor behavior in marine mammals, primarily cetaceans and manatees, specifically, how they use sound in ecological processes. The cetaceans, or whales and dolphins, are divided into two main groups, the toothed whales (odontocetes) and the baleen whales (mysticetes). One of my specific areas of research is the use of echolocation and foraging behavior in one of the odontocetes, the bottlenose dolphin.

      "overview": "With his graduate students, Dr. Oren quantifies the components of water flux in forest ecosystems and the influence of biotic and abiotic factors on water and, due to strong links between carbon and water, on carbon flux. Climate variability, including variations in air temperature, vapor pressure deficit, incoming radiation and soil moisture, and environmental change, including elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide, affect the intra- and inter-annual patterns and amounts of water used by forest ecosystems, and its spatial distribution, as well as carbon uptake and sequestration. The variation of water flux influence the temporal and spatial partitioning of incoming radiation between latent and sensible heat. Using a local mass balance approach and detailed measurements of water flux and driving variables in the soil, plants, and the atmosphere, in forests from Brazil to Alaska, Dr. Oren evaluates the likely responses of different forest ecosystems to environmental change.",

Prior to joining \n              the Duke faculty in 1979, Professor Peirce was a Senior Engineer \n              in the Environmental and Energy Division of Booz, Allen and Hamilton \n              in Washington, D.C. </p>\n            <p> Professor Peirce's current research activities build on his interests \n              in mechanics and include the study of physical, chemical, and microbiological \n              aspects of particle-fluid interactions in treatment reactors, waste-amended \n              and chemically-applied soils, and clay barriers to waste migration. \n              Laboratory and modeling studies of gases, non-water liquids passing \n              through selected porous media are leading to novel solutions to \n              hazardous waste processing and storage problems. Current emphasis \n              is on the study of trace gas production and transport in soil with \n              a focus on nitric oxide (NO), a precursor to ozone formation and \n              trace gases from fungicides and herbicides as precursors to endocrine \n              disruptors in the lower levels of the troposphere. </p>\n            <p>In 1984, Professor Peirce was among the first recipients of the \n              Presidential Young Investigator Award, presented by the National \n              Science Foundation. This award and other financial support from \n              the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Department of \n              Energy, the U.S. Department of Education, the State of North Carolina, \n              and industrial sponsors have enabled him to pursue his research \n              interests. </p>\n            <p> Professor Peirce has coauthored two successful textbooks: Environmental \n              Engineering and Environmental Pollution and Control.

      "overview": "I direct the Brain Stimulation Engineering Lab (BSEL) which focuses on the development and modeling of devices and application paradigms for transcranial brain stimulation. Transcranial brain stimulation involves non-invasive delivery of fields (e.g., electric and magnetic) to the brain that modulate neural activity. Transcranial brain stimulation is increasingly used as a tool for brain research and a therapeutic intervention in neurology and psychiatry. My lab works closely with neuroscientists and clinicians to translate novel brain stimulation technology and optimize existing techniques. For example, we have developed a device for transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) that allows extensive control over the magnetic pulse parameters. We are currently deploying this device to optimize the magnetic stimulus in neuromodulatory TMS paradigms. We are also developing efficient algorithms for response estimation and individualization of brain stimulation. Another line of work is finite element computational modeling of the fields induced in the brain by electric and magnetic stimulation. My lab is involved in the integration of transcranial brain stimulation with imaging modalities such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG), as well as the evaluation of the safety of device&ndash;device interactions, for example between transcranial stimulators and implants like deep-brain stimulation (DBS) systems. <br /><br />In parallel, I pursue projects related to power electronics, with applications in electrical energy conversion and storage. Recent projects include modular multilevel converters for solar energy conversion and storage, grid storage applications, as well as electric vehicles.",

      "overview": "<p>Dr. David E. Schaad is a registered professional engineer in twenty-one states, a Board Certified Environmental Engineer with specialties in both Hazardous Waste Management/Site Remediation and Water Supply/Wastewater Engineering, a Diplomate of the American Academy of Water Resources Engineers, and a licensed contractor and a qualifier in Building, Highways and Public Utilities in the State of North Carolina.&nbsp; With an undergraduate degree from Denison University, a Masters from the University of Colorado, Boulder, and a doctorate from Duke University, Dr. Schaad began the first stage of his career working for various firms including: Parsons Engineering Science, Marshall Miller and Associates, Appian Consulting Engineers, and AMEC. During that time Dr. Schaad helped lead teams of resourceful and dedicated engineers who tackled a variety of challenging and innovative technical projects (hazardous waste and water/wastewater) for a diverse set of clients including the Norfolk Southern and CSX Railway Companies, the North Carolina and Virginia Departments of Transportation, and North Carolina State University (NCSU), among others.&nbsp;&nbsp; The most significant project Dr. Schaad designed and managed was the remediation of the NCSU Lot 86 National Priorities List (NPL) Site, where shallow soil mixing was used to encapsulate approximately 11,000 cubic yards of chemical and hazardous waste into a ten foot thick monolith about half the size of a football field.&nbsp; After a successful decade and a half as a design engineer, Dr. Schaad transitioned into investing in the next generation of leaders by becoming a Professor of the Practice at Duke University where he could assist future engineers in developing their design skills and ability to move from thinking to conceptualization to implementation. In response to the December 2004 tsunami which devastated coastlines in Southeast Asia, and Hurricane Katrina which impacted the New Orleans area, he began a new course focused on response, rebuilding, and resilience and lead teams to both areas, with the largest being 130 students going to St. Bernard&rsquo;s Parish over the spring break of 2006, and he continued leading teams to New Orleans every other year for a decade since then.&nbsp; He helped establish Duke Engineers for International Development (https://sites.duke.edu/deid/), which is a student group that works in collaboration with local partners to address identified community needs.&nbsp; His experiential, service-learning pedagogy has helped facilitate over 30 international (and a few domestic) projects impacting over 300 student engineers and over a dozen communities building rain water harvesting tanks, water distribution systems, vehicular and pedestrian bridges, health clinics and primary schools.&nbsp; Dr. Schaad recently led the effort to establish a new Certificate in Global Development Engineering (http://cee.duke.edu/undergrad/degrees/certificates/global-development-engineering), which on top of their major, helps students broaden their global competency, establish technical depth in a specific track, and have a mentored experiential design/construction experience in the United States or abroad.&nbsp; Dr. Schaad has taught over eighty courses at Duke and has been recognized with departmental and/or school-wide awards for his teaching and mentoring. He currently serves as the President of the Eastern Branch of the North Carolina Section of ASCE.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

      "overview": "<doc>Our current research involves the use of computer-generated phantoms and simulation techniques to investigate and optimize medical imaging systems and methods. Medical imaging simulation involves virtual experiments carried out entirely on the computer using computational models for the patients as well as the imaging devices. Simulation is a powerful tool for characterizing, evaluating, and optimizing medical imaging systems. A vital aspect of simulation is to have realistic models of the subject's anatomy as well as accurate models for the physics of the imaging process. Without this, the results of the simulation may not be indicative of what would occur in actual clinical studies and would, therefore, have limited practical value. We are leading the development of realistic simulation tools for use toward human and small animal imaging research. <br/> <br/>These tools have a wide variety of applications in many different imaging modalities to investigate the effects of anatomical, physiological, physical, and instrumentational factors on medical imaging and to research new image acquisition strategies, image processing and reconstruction methods, and image visualization and interpretation techniques. We are currently applying them to the field of x-ray CT. The motivation for this work is the lack of sufficiently rigorous methods for optimizing the image quality and radiation dose in x-ray CT to the clinical needs of a given procedure. The danger of unnecessary radiation exposure from CT applications, especially for pediatrics, is just now being addressed. Optimization is essential in order for new and emerging CT applications to be truly useful and not represent a danger to the patient. Given the relatively high radiation doses required of current CT systems, thorough optimization is unlikely to ever be done in live patients. It would be prohibitively expensive to fabricate physical phantoms to simulate a realistic range of patient sizes and clinical needs especially when physiologic motion needs to be considered.  The only practical approach to the optimization problem is through the use of realistic computer simulation tools developed in our work.</doc>",

      "overview": "Dr. David R. Smith is currently the James B. Duke Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Duke University. He is also Director of the Center for Metamaterial and Integrated Plasmonics at Duke and holds&nbsp;the positions of Adjunct Associate Professor in the Physics Department at the University of California, San Diego, and Visiting Professor of Physics at Imperial College, London. Dr. Smith received his Ph.D. in 1994 in Physics from the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). Dr. Smith's research interests include the theory, simulation and characterization of unique electromagnetic structures, including photonic crystals and metamaterials. &nbsp;<br /><br />Smith is best known for his theoretical and experimental work on electromagnetic metamaterials. Metamaterials are artificially structured materials, whose electromagnetic properties can be tailored and tuned in ways not easily accomplished with conventional materials. Smith has been at the forefront in the development of numerical methods to design and characterize metamaterials, and has also provided many of the key experiments that have helped to illustrate the potential that metamaterials offer. Smith and his colleagues at UCSD demonstrated the first left-handed (or negative index) metamaterial at microwave frequencies in 2000--a material that had been predicted theoretically more than thirty years prior by Russian physicist Victor Veselago. No naturally occurring material or compound with a negative index-of-refraction had ever been reported until this experiment. In 2001, Smith and colleagues followed up with a second experiment confirming one of Veselago's key conjectures: the 'reversal' of Snell's law. These two papers--the first published in Physical Review Letters and the second in Science--generated enormous interest throughout the community in the possibility of metamaterials to extend and augment the properties of conventional materials. Both papers have now been cited more than 3,000 times each. <br /><br />Since those first metamaterial experiments, Smith has continued to study the fundamentals and potential applications of negative index media and metamaterials. In 2004, Smith began studying the potential of metamaterials as a means to produce novel gradient index media. By varying the index-of-refraction throughout a material, an entire class of optical elements (such as lenses) can be formed. Smith showed that metamaterials could access a much larger range of design space, since both the magnetic and the electric properties could be graded independently. Smith and colleagues demonstrated several versions of gradient index optics, an activity that continues in his lab today. The introduction of controlled spatial gradients in the electromagnetic properties of a metamaterial flows naturally into the broad concept of transformation optics - a new electromagnetic design approach proposed by Sir John Pendry in 2006. To illustrate of the novelty of this design approach, Pendry, Schurig and Smith suggested in 2006 that an 'invisibility cloak' could be realized by a metamaterial implementation of a transformation optical design.

      "overview": "Dr. David R. Smith is currently the James B. Duke Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Duke University. He is also Director of the Center for Metamaterial and Integrated Plasmonics at Duke and holds&nbsp;the positions of Adjunct Associate Professor in the Physics Department at the University of California, San Diego, and Visiting Professor of Physics at Imperial College, London. Dr. Smith received his Ph.D. in 1994 in Physics from the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). Dr. Smith's research interests include the theory, simulation and characterization of unique electromagnetic structures, including photonic crystals and metamaterials. &nbsp;<br /><br />Smith is best known for his theoretical and experimental work on electromagnetic metamaterials. Metamaterials are artificially structured materials, whose electromagnetic properties can be tailored and tuned in ways not easily accomplished with conventional materials. Smith has been at the forefront in the development of numerical methods to design and characterize metamaterials, and has also provided many of the key experiments that have helped to illustrate the potential that metamaterials offer. Smith and his colleagues at UCSD demonstrated the first left-handed (or negative index) metamaterial at microwave frequencies in 2000--a material that had been predicted theoretically more than thirty years prior by Russian physicist Victor Veselago. No naturally occurring material or compound with a negative index-of-refraction had ever been reported until this experiment. In 2001, Smith and colleagues followed up with a second experiment confirming one of Veselago's key conjectures: the 'reversal' of Snell's law.

Each square element is only 0.2 mm on a side. In addition, we have developed such 2D arrays to fit inside of intra-cardiac catheters only 2 mm in diameter for guidance of cardiac interventional procedures such as mapping and ablation of atrial fibrillation.

      "overview": "RESEARCH INTERESTS <br /> <br /> Dr. Toth specializes in the evaluation and surgical treatment of vitreoretinal diseases in infants, children and adults, and in novel research resulting in the clinical application of optical coherence tomography (OCT)&nbsp;imaging in surgery and at the bedside. Her clinical interests and skills include the surgical treatment of macular diseases (such as, macular hole, epiretinal membrane and vitreomacular traction), retinal detachment, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR), and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP).&nbsp;<br /><br />Dr. Toth&nbsp;is a world expert in retinal imaging with optical coherence tomography (OCT) and pioneered both the first use of a research hand-held spectral domain OCT system for infant examination and the first&nbsp;intraoperative OCT-guided ophthalmic surgical system. For infants and children, Dr. Toth's multidisciplinary team has demonstrated novel eye findings that are visible only with OCT imaging and that are often associated with brain disease or challenges of brain development. In surgery, Dr. Toth performed the world's first intraoperative OCT imaging and the first swept-source OCT imaging with heads-up display during&nbsp;retinal surgery. With colleagues in the Duke Eye Center and in Biomedical Engineering, she perfecting such techniques. She has been repeatedly honored among the Best Doctors in America. <br /> <br />Dr. Toth is also<a href=\"fds.duke.edu/db/pratt/BME/faculty/cynthia.toth\"> professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering</a> in the Pratt School of Engineering. Her primary research interests are in translational research and early-application clinical trials with a focus on novel retinal imaging with spectral domain and swept source optical coherence tomography (SD and SSOCT). Dr. Toth's Laboratory, the Duke Advanced Research in Spectral Domain/Swept Source OCT Imaging (DARSI) Laboratory centers on improving early diagnostic methods, imaging biomarkers and therapies for both age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and for retinal diseases in children. <a href=\"http://www.duke.edu/~sf59/\">Sina Farsiu, PhD</a>, provides expertise in advanced image processing for SDOCT in the DARSI Laboratory. In collaboration with <a href=\"fds.duke.edu/db/pratt/BME/faculty/joseph.izatt\">Joseph Izatt, PhD</a>&nbsp; in Biomedical Engineering, the DARSI team is currently applying SD and SSOCT to the care of retinal diseases and especially in microsurgery in adults and in children in several studies including NIH funded investigations.&nbsp;<br /> <br />Dr. Toth was also co-founder and&nbsp;has been&nbsp;the Director of Grading for OCT for the <a href=\"http://www.dukeoct.org/index_html\">Duke Reading Center </a>and has designed and directed OCT analysis for&nbsp;numerous multicenter clinical trials including the Comparisons of AMD Treatment Trials (CATT). The Duke Reading&nbsp;Center provides support in training, data acquisition, and grading for multicenter&nbsp;clinical trials utilizing optical coherence tomography as an outcome measure. <br /> <br />Dr. Toth chaired the multicenter Age Related Eye Disease Study 2 Ancillary SDOCT (A2ASDOCT) Study and has participated as site PI in the AREDS2. She also&nbsp;led studies of macular translocation surgery (MT360) for patients with severe AMD, along with co-investigator Dr. Sharon Freedman. Macular translocation surgery was a salvage treatment for AMD patients who lost vision due to neovascular AMD, prior to the current era of anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor treatments. The surgery resulted in&nbsp;an auto-transplant of the retina, isolating the retina from the underlying&nbsp;choroidal and retinal pigment epithelial pathology. Imaging and retinal function data from those studies have contributed to teasing out events in the macula related to vision loss.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://dukeeyecenter.duke.edu/research/faculty-labs/toth-darsi-lab\">Learn More about the Toth-DARSI Lab</a>",

Previously a research faculty at Duke, he works on applied and theoretical aspects of metamaterials, nanomaterials and microstructured media. His main focus at Duke is on engineering technologically-relevant electromagnetic and acoustic properties of such media across the spectrum, and designing device prototypes based on metamaterials. His demonstration of all-dielectric cloaking at Duke (2013), and the theoretical proofs of metamaterial promise for wireless power transfer and hydrodynamic wake suppression (2011), are recognized worldwide as the starting points for novel industry-relevant metamaterial ideas. Dr. Urzhumov developed homogenization theories and numerical techniques for effective material property predictions, and continues to work on efficient numerical optimization methods for micro- and nanostructured media. He has interest in materials science aspects of metals, semiconductors, phonon-polaritonic and other plasmonic media, dielectrics and their micro/nanostructured forms, in particular their electromagnetic, electronic and phononic properties. While his pre-Duke works are mostly in plasmonic metamaterials, here he expanded his research into the mechanics, dynamics and acoustics of fluid, solid and hybrid metamaterials, with emphasis on underwater acoustics. Dr. Urzhumov&rsquo;s expertise is in cross-disciplinary, multi-physics analysis of complex structures and systems, which require unprecedented computational efficiency.<!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>\r\n

      "overview": "<doc>Dr. Vann's research interests encompass the physiology, medicine, and epidemiology of special respiratory environments and the equipment and procedures to allow safe human exposures. Relevant environments include diving, compressed air work, mountaineering, and aerospace. The pressure chambers in Dr. Vann's laboratory can simulate high altitude or high pressure under dry or immersed conditions while controlling inspired oxygen, carbon dioxide, inert gas, and total pressure to desired levels. Measurement capabilities include pulmonary function, arterial blood gases, and nitrogen uptake or elimination. Specific investigations have included: (1) environmental and physiological factors affecting cerebral blood flow, cerebral oxygenation, and CNS oxygen toxicity; (2) nitrogen elimination during oxygen breathing; (3) effect of hypercapnia on arterial oxygen saturation and cerebral oxygenation during hypoxia; (4) effects of hyperventilation and oxygen breathing on breath-hold; (5) mechanisms and locations of in vitro and in vivo bubble formation and their relation to decompression sickness; (6) physiological damage resulting from in situ bubbles and from bubbles associated with implanted biomaterials. Respiratory physiology studies have included optimizing oxygen delivery equipment for sea level and altitude. Dr. Vann has a particular interest in decompression sickness. Human decompression studies have included: (1) factors affecting decompression sickness in astronauts during extravehicular activity in space; (2) surface interval oxygen and in-water oxygen repetitive dive tables; (3) determination of safe surface intervals before flying after diving; (4) use of dive computers to record recreational dive profile and medical outcome data for the Divers Alert Network; (5) development of statistical models of decompression sickness and acute mountain sickness. Dr. Vann's current active projects include probabilistic modeling of decompression sickness and the analysis of diving injury and fatality data (including open-circuit, rebreathers, and cave diving) with the Divers Alert Network.</doc>",

      "overview": "Professor Virgin's research is centered on studying the behavior of nonlinear dynamical systems. This work may be broadly divided into two components. First, investigation of the fundamental nature of nonlinear systems based on a mathematical description of their underlying equations of motion.

      "overview": "<p>Dr. von Ramm's research interests include  diagnostic ultrasound imaging systems, IR imaging, medical instrumentation and \ntheir new applications.</p>\n<p><strong>Ultrasound Imaging.</strong> The main direction of research is a development of new ultrasonic techniques for better visualization of the human anatomy, improved ultrasonic detection of tumors and other space occupying lesions as well as improved detection and visualization of blood flow. Several generations of phased array Ultrasound imaging systems have been designed and constructed in our laboratories to assist the clinical value of various novel Ultrasound imaging techniques. Research interests range from basic physics of acoustics and properties of materials required in transducer construction, through the design and construction of advanced imaging systems, to the clinical application and evaluation of new instruments or measurement principles. Of particular interest has been the quantization of cardiac function using Ultrasound. </p>\n<P>High Speed Ultrasound Imaging is a project with a long-term goal to design, construct and clinically evaluate a real-time volumetric (3-D) ultrasonic imaging system which is also capable of visualizing and accurately representing blood flow in three dimensions. This instrument will permit the non-invasive assessment of tumor and organ volumes as well as cardiac chamber volumes. Such measurements have the potential of improving decision on tumor treatment, of assessing congenital and pathological states of various organs and of evaluating cardiac function on a serial basis. Incorporation of angle-independent 3-D flow measurements will permit the rapid noninvasive assessment of flow in major peripheral vessels, deep abdominal vessels and coronary arteries. Flow imaging will also delineate the lumen of the vessel thereby simplifying detection of atherosclerotic clacks. \n<P>Another project Real-Time 3-D Ultrasonic Data Acquisition, is aimed at the design, construction and evaluation of a new generation pulsed array Ultrasound imaging system based on VLSI ASICs and specialized linear integrated circuits. This system will eventually feature256 parallel receive channels with 64 to 1 parallel processing. Up to 64simultaneous B-mode will be acquired in real time so that virtually any view of the anatomy can be visualized on line. \n<P>Scatter Imaging is the focus of yet another research effort which is directed toward imaging with Ultrasound energies scattered at various angles from soft tissue. Studies are directed towards assessing the viability of such imaging and improving contrast between tissue types and generally improving image quality. This method may also permit the quantitative determination of physical tissue parameters such as ultrasonic propagation velocities. \n<P>Medical Center equipment totally dedicated to the Ultrasound work includes the second generation phased array instrument constructed at Duke, a VAX11/780, a Kontron image processor, electronic test equipment, extensive video equipment including an In star 240 frame per second instrument. In addition there are 9 commercial phased array instruments in clinical use with various transducer probes that can be scheduled for research purposes.\n\n<P><strong>Cardiovascular Technologies.</strong> The National Science Foundation Engineering Research Center for Emerging Cardiovascular Technologies (NSF/ERC) at Duke University incorporates the latest knowledge and methodology in custom integrated electronics, biosensors, system design, and simulation to develop a new generation of Cardiac Interventional and Medical Imaging Systems. This interdisciplinary Center brings together the active research programs of well-established engineering and biomedical researchers and industrial investigators to advance biomedical systems, devices, and instrumentation in the coming decade. Research interests include the study of interventional stimulation and catheterization procedures aimed at the development of a new generation of devices and procedures for the treatment of arrhythmias, atherosclerosis, and other vascular diseases. Research contributors possess highly specialized skills in medical research, biomedical engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, materials science, and micro electronic technology. All of these skills are required in a systems approach to developing implantable devices and interventional methods. <BR>\n  <BR>\n  Other research groups focus on the development of high speed 3-D imaging systems including two major projects: 3-D real-time ultrasonic imaging and magnetic resonance microscopy. The extensions of these modalities to dynamic, three-dimensional imaging capabilities should double the present Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging sales. These imaging and display systems will also be of major importance in the in vivo evaluation of the systems. <BR>\n\n  <BR>\n  The vision of current cardiac stimulation research projects is to prevent sudden cardiac death by developing several different types of high technology devices to be implanted within the body. These devices will halt or prevent ventricular fibrillation, the primary cause of sudden cardiac death. <BR>\n  <BR>\n  The key technical problems blocking advances in the development of devices to prevent sudden cardiac death are a lack of knowledge of (a) the distribution of the electrical field created throughout the heart by a set of stimulating electrodes, (b) the reaction of the heart cells to a given electrical field as a function of the cell's electrophysiologic state at the time of the shock, and (c) the individuals who are at risk for sudden cardiac death and thus are candidates for these devices. </P>\n<P>    The key research goals and objectives are to obtain and evaluate experimental knowledge by using specially constructed, computer-assisted data acquisition systems and electrode arrays to record the intrinsic electrical activity of the heart before and after a large electrical stimulus, as well as the potentials created throughout the heart by the stimulus itself. The correctness of bioelectric simulation and concepts are assessed by comparing these predictions to the measured data.<BR>\n    <BR>\n    This work is strongly dependent on the circuits, sensors, and simulation research projects that are significant strengths of the NSF/ERC program. Investigators are developing systems requirements and specifications for array transducers, custom integrated circuits, integrated systems, biosensors, and simulations that focus the core research activities in micro electronics and biosensor design and fabrication. <BR>\n\n    <BR>\n    A major goal of this Center is to improve engineering educational programs by expanding the opportunities for engineering students to interact with industrial investigators. In particular, the Center is initiating an approach to graduate and undergraduate engineering education in which NSF/ERC Fellows receive substantive advising and individually tailored instruction from leading engineers in industry. \n</P>",

In addition there are 9 commercial phased array instruments in clinical use with various transducer probes that can be scheduled for research purposes.\n\n<P><strong>Cardiovascular Technologies.</strong> The National Science Foundation Engineering Research Center for Emerging Cardiovascular Technologies (NSF/ERC) at Duke University incorporates the latest knowledge and methodology in custom integrated electronics, biosensors, system design, and simulation to develop a new generation of Cardiac Interventional and Medical Imaging Systems. This interdisciplinary Center brings together the active research programs of well-established engineering and biomedical researchers and industrial investigators to advance biomedical systems, devices, and instrumentation in the coming decade. Research interests include the study of interventional stimulation and catheterization procedures aimed at the development of a new generation of devices and procedures for the treatment of arrhythmias, atherosclerosis, and other vascular diseases. Research contributors possess highly specialized skills in medical research, biomedical engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, materials science, and micro electronic technology. All of these skills are required in a systems approach to developing implantable devices and interventional methods. <BR>\n  <BR>\n  Other research groups focus on the development of high speed 3-D imaging systems including two major projects: 3-D real-time ultrasonic imaging and magnetic resonance microscopy. The extensions of these modalities to dynamic, three-dimensional imaging capabilities should double the present Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging sales. These imaging and display systems will also be of major importance in the in vivo evaluation of the systems. <BR>\n\n  <BR>\n  The vision of current cardiac stimulation research projects is to prevent sudden cardiac death by developing several different types of high technology devices to be implanted within the body. These devices will halt or prevent ventricular fibrillation, the primary cause of sudden cardiac death. <BR>\n  <BR>\n  The key technical problems blocking advances in the development of devices to prevent sudden cardiac death are a lack of knowledge of (a) the distribution of the electrical field created throughout the heart by a set of stimulating electrodes, (b) the reaction of the heart cells to a given electrical field as a function of the cell's electrophysiologic state at the time of the shock, and (c) the individuals who are at risk for sudden cardiac death and thus are candidates for these devices. </P>\n<P>    The key research goals and objectives are to obtain and evaluate experimental knowledge by using specially constructed, computer-assisted data acquisition systems and electrode arrays to record the intrinsic electrical activity of the heart before and after a large electrical stimulus, as well as the potentials created throughout the heart by the stimulus itself. The correctness of bioelectric simulation and concepts are assessed by comparing these predictions to the measured data.<BR>\n    <BR>\n    This work is strongly dependent on the circuits, sensors, and simulation research projects that are significant strengths of the NSF/ERC program. Investigators are developing systems requirements and specifications for array transducers, custom integrated circuits, integrated systems, biosensors, and simulations that focus the core research activities in micro electronics and biosensor design and fabrication. <BR>\n\n    <BR>\n    A major goal of this Center is to improve engineering educational programs by expanding the opportunities for engineering students to interact with industrial investigators. In particular, the Center is initiating an approach to graduate and undergraduate engineering education in which NSF/ERC Fellows receive substantive advising and individually tailored instruction from leading engineers in industry. \n</P>",

      "overview": "<p>Dr. Wax's research interests include optical spectroscopy for early cancer detection, novel microscopy and \ninterferometry techniques.</p>\n<p>The study of intact, living cells with optical spectroscopy offers the opportunity to observe cellular structure, organization and dynamics in a way that is not possible with traditional methods. We have developed a set of novel spectroscopic techniques for measuring spatial, temporal and refractive structure on sub-hertz and sub-wavelength scales based on using low-coherence interferometry (LCI) to detect scattered light. We have applied these techniques in different types of cell biology experiments. In one experiment, LCI measurements of the angular pattern of backscattered light are used to determine non-invasively the structure of sub-cellular organelles in cell monolayers, and the components of epithelial tissue from freshly excised rat esophagus. This work has potential as a diagnostic method for early cancer detection. In another experiment, LCI phase measurements are used to examine volume changes of epithelial cells in a monolayer in response to environmental osmolarity changes. Although cell volume changes have been measured previously, this work demonstrates for the first time the volume of just a few cells (2 or 3) tracked continuously and in situ.<BR>\n</p>",

      "overview": "<p>My research is primarily in the area of advanced instrumentation for \ndiagnosis and treatment of electrophysiological problems. This research covers two primary organ systems: the heart and the brain.</p>\n<p>One thrust of the cardiac-based work is centered on atrial fibrillation and in particular on very low energy atrial defibrillation strategies. The goal is to produce a device that can defibrillate the atria with a painless series of electrical impulses. A second area of interest is the study of the biophysics of radio frequency ablation of the heart. A third avenue of research in the cardiac area is the development of new \n    instruments and techniques for tracking interventional devices within the body without the use of ionizing radiation. These devices primarily \n  rely on ultrasound technology. There is a strong collaborative effort in this area with the Duke Ultrasound group in the Department of Biomedical Engineering. The long term goal of this work is to develop technology to deliver image-guided therapy to target tissues in the heart and other organs.</p>\n<p>In neuroengineering, we are currently developing a \"brainchip\" that would telemeter information recorded directly from neurons in the brain to a remote device. This IC based technology is being developed for application in neuro-prosthetic or brain controlled devices. There is a close collaboration on this project between our lab and the laboratory of Dr. Miguel Nicolelis the Department of Neurobiology. We are also developing advanced neural recoding systems to use on unrestrained, untethered animals as they learn to perform certain tasks.</p>",

      "overview": "<p>Professor Wright is experienced in the application of artificial intelligence methods for the analysis of failed mechanical elements. After completion of two demonstration systems (FAXS I and FAXS II), a full-scale system (FALCON) has been implemented. The expert system produces as a final product a technical report which includes a diagnosis of both the mechanism of the fracture and the cause of failure. Categorization with Bayesian probabilities has proven more efficient than the commonly employed production rule approach. Additionally, the report includes a list of past case studies most similar to the current study.</p>\n\n<p>A number of extensions to FALCON are now anticipated. The ability of the system to compare and to quantify the similarity between case studies has led us to believe that a method of learning without direct contact with experts is feasible. Further, adding the task of recommending design changes will require significant program development. In brief, the research brings together the disciplines of materials science, mechanical design and artificial intelligence.</p>",

      "overview": "<p>Our mission at PI-Lab is to develop state-of-the-art photoacoustic tomography (PAT) technologies and translate PAT advances into diagnostic and therapeutic applications, especially in functional brain imaging and early cancer theranostics. PAT is the most sensitive modality for imaging rich optical absorption contrast over a wide range of spatial scales at high speed, and is one of the fastest growing biomedical imaging technologies. Using numerous endogenous and exogenous contrasts, PAT can provide high-resolution images at scales covering organelles, cells, tissues, organs, small-animal organisms, up to humans, and can reveal tissue&rsquo;s anatomical, functional, metabolic, and even histologic properties, with molecular and neuronal specificity.</p>\r\n<p>At PI-Lab, we develop PAT technologies with novel and advanced imaging performance, in terms of spatial resolutions, imaging speed, penetration depth, detection sensitivity, and functionality. We are interested with all aspects of PAT technology innovations, including efficient light illumination, high-sensitivity ultrasonic detection, super-resolution PAT, high-speed imaging acquisition, novel PA genetic contrast, and precise image reconstruction. On top of the technological advancements, we are devoted to serve the broad life science and medical communities with matching PAT systems for various research and clinical needs. With its unique contrast mechanism, high scalability, and inherent functional and molecular imaging capabilities, PAT is well suited for a variety of pre-clinical applications, especially for studying tumor angiogenesis, cancer hypoxia, and brain disorders; it is also a promising tool for clinical applications in procedures such as cancer screening, melanoma staging, and endoscopic examination.</p>",

Our approach draws inspiration from electronic circuit theory through the development highly flexible methods for transporting particles above magnetic thin film patterns either reversibly (conductor) or irreversibly (rectifier), storing cells in well-defined regions of space either temporarily (capacitor) or permanently (data storage), switching current pathways at selected junctions (transistor) and coordinating a large set of electronic functions with few input wires (multiplexer). When combined with microfluidic systems that allow for repeated doses of pharmaceuticals, we will have a developed a platform that is ripe to have a major impact on the field of HIV eradication and cancer suppression.<br />2) <strong>Multiparticle assembly of colloidal crystals</strong>. The goal of this project is to understand the formation and phase transitions occuring inside single crystals composed of alloys of colloidal particles.&nbsp; Here, we are interested in observing crystals forming from magnetic and non-magnetic colloidal particles dispersed inside ferrofluid.&nbsp; We are just beginning to solve the questions of how to grow large single crystals, and how to transform these crystals by tilting of an external magnetic field.&nbsp; The results of this project will serve as useful models for understanding how crystals form and transform in the corollary atomic scale materials in nature.",

      "overview": "<p>Dr. Yuan's research interests include drug and gene delivery, mechanisms of molecular transport in cells and tissues, and tumor pathophysiology.</p>\n\n<p>Cure of cancer through chemotherapy requires drug molecules to reach all tumor cells at an adequately high concentration. At present, such a requirement cannot be satisfied in most patients. This is because (a) amount of drugs that can be administered into patients is limited by normal tissue tolerance and (b) drug distribution and cellular response to drugs in tumors are heterogeneous. Therefore, cells in regions with drug concentration below the therapeutic level will cause tumor recurrence and they may also develop resistance to future treatment. </p>\n\n<p>The goal of our research is two-fold. One is to improve delivery of therapeutic agents in solid tumors; and the second is to understand mechanisms of drug resistance in tumors caused by intrinsic cellular heterogeneity and physiological barriers. These studies may provide useful information on how to improve clinical treatment of cancer based on currently available drugs or molecular medicines in the future. </p>\n\n<p>Research projects in our lab include quantification of transport parameters, delivery of drugs encapsulated in temperature sensitive liposomes, physical interventions of drugs, electric field-mediated gene delivery, mathematical modeling of drug and gene delivery.<br>",

Fabrication, manipulation and characterization of stimulus-responsive biomolecular and bio-inspired polymeric nanostructures on surfaces;\n   2. Nanotechnology of soft-wet materials and hybrid biological/non-biological microdevices;\n   3. Receptor-ligand interactions relevant to the diagnostics of infectious diseases;\n   4. Friction of soft-wet materials, specifically the role of glycoproteins on friction in diarthroidal joints.\n\nThese four broad lines of inquiry deal with fundamental behaviors of soft-wet materials on surfaces and interfaces. The design and fabrication of these interfaces using \"smart\" polymeric and biomolecular nanostructures, and the characterization of the resulting structures, are critically important for the development of biomolecular sensors and devices and for bioinspired materials. Key approaches and tools I use in my research are: bottom-up organization on the molecular scale, through self-assembly, in-situ polymerization, and manipulation of intermolecular interactions; topdown fabrication, through scanning probe nanolithography; stimulus-responsive polymers; molecular recognition; and new approaches to sensing and manipulation.
